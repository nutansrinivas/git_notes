1. how to create a git repository


 a) git init - 	This command creates an empty git repository - 
	 	basically a .git directory with subdirectories for objects, refs/heads, refs/tags, and template files. 
		An initial HEAD file that references the HEAD of the master branch is also created.


 b) add remote repository url to local repository - git remote add remote_name remote_repo_url
		This command will map remote repository to a reference in your local repository. 
 c) push the local repo branch to the remote repo at remote_name - git push -u remote_name local_branch_name
